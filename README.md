__Assignment 1 Description: Maximum Gold__

Given a set of gold bars of various weights and a backpack that can hold at most W pounds, place as much gold as possible into the backpack. Constraints. 1≤W≤104. There are at most 103 gold bars, the weight of each gold bar is at most 105.

__Assignment 2 Description: Arithmetic Expression__

Parenthesize an arithmetic expression to maxi- mize its value. 
Input. A string s=s0s1⋯s2n of length at most 29. Each symbol at an even position of s is a digit (that is, an integer from 0 to 9) while each symbol at an odd position is one of three operations from {+, -, *}

Output. The maximum value of the given arithmetic expression among all possible orders of applying arithmetic operations.

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)
